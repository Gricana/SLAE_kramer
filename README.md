# SLAE_kramer
-------------------------------------------------
	The developed software allows you to solve a system of linear algebraic equations by the Kramer method. In this project I applied the OOP of the C++ 	language and made a GUI using the Qt framework
	If the user has not filled in the coefficients or the vector of free terms completely, the program warns him about it and the calculation does not occur. It is also possible to start solving the next SLA without opening the application each time.
	In the process of solving a system of linear algebraic equations, the program 	will display a message about the absence or set of roots, or calculate the roots (if there are any)
