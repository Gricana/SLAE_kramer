# SLAE_kramer
-------------------------------------------------
	The developed software allows you to solve a system of linear algebraic equations by the Kramer method. In this project I applied the OOP of the C++ 	language and made a GUI using the Qt framework
	If the user has not filled in the coefficients or the vector of free terms completely, the program warns him about it and the calculation does not occur. It is also possible to start solving the next SLAE without opening the application each time.
	In the process of solving a system of linear algebraic equations, the program will display a message about the absence or set of roots, or calculate the roots (if there are any)
	After the calculation is completed, the program allows you to save the result of the work to a text file. To eliminate the possibility of clogging the file in which the result of the program is saved, the relevance of the saved data is equal to 1 day (i.e., when you save the results to the same file the next day, all previously saved results are deleted)
